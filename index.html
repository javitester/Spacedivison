                <h3>Astraeus I</h3>
                <p>
                    The Astraeus I marks the inaugural official project of Team Zenit at Universidad Europea. Initiated in late October 2023 and successfully concluded in early 2024, this project represents a significant milestone for our club. 
                    The Astraeus I is a uniquely designed rocket, entirely constructed from carbon fiber, which was meticulously treated and manufactured by our club members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary objective of this project was to obtain the L1 rocketry certification, achieved by successfully launching and precisely landing the rocket. 
                    This accomplishment not only demonstrates our technical capabilities but also serves as a foundational step in our journey of learning about rocket design and manufacturing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the body of the Astraeus I will be repurposed for the construction of our next rocket, the Astraeus II, which is already under development. 
                    This project has laid the groundwork for our future endeavors and continues to inspire our commitment to advancing in the field of rocketry.

                <h3>Astraeus II</h3>
                <p>
                    The Astraeus II marks the second official project undertaken by Team Zenit at Universidad Europea. 
                    The main goal is to refurbish the body of the existing Astraeus I, implementing modifications to improve its performance. These upgrades include the integration of an I motor and advanced electronics such as a pressure gauge, altimeter, and velocimeter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The successful launch of the Astraeus II took place on October 20, 2024, further showcasing our club’s dedication to innovation and technical excellence.

                <h3>Vrackie I</h3>
                <p>
                    Vrackie I is Team Zenit’s latest project, designed as an enhanced iteration of our previous rockets, Astraeus I and Astraeus II. It benefits greatly from the knowledge and experience we gained during their development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The manufacturing of Vrackie I is already underway. The rocket features a body constructed primarily from carbon fiber, except for the electronic bay, which is made from glass fiber to facilitate radio signal transmission for monitoring purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vrackie I aims to obtain an L2 certification by utilizing a powerful solid motor, building on the foundation of the L1 certification achieved with Astraeus I.
